# This config file contain two lists of regex that will tests for ads.
# if you wish to modify or remove any regex, feel free to do so.
# You can add and remove keys as long as two keys don't use the same key twice.

# WARNING_REGEX:
# In the WARNING_REGEX section each individual match from each regex gives one warning to the subtitle block.
# Blocks also receive additional warnings if they are adjacent to other blocks that contain ads.
# 1 warning is ignored
# 2 warnings will be print the block as a WARNING in the log.
# 3 warnings or more will remove the entire block.

# PURGE_REGEX:
# Any match against the regexes in the PURGE_REGEX section will remove the entire subtitle block:

# Remember that regex symbols like \^$.|?*+([{ have special meaning in regex and if you want to test for the
# literal character you'll need to escape it with '\'
# for example: matching "www." would require a regex like: "www\."
# you can test regexes online on an regex-tester tool like https://regex101.com/

# Feel free to ask me any question on github.
